/**
 * The SnapshotService enables you to list, insert, store, and retrieve
 * snapshots.
 *
 * Currently there are two types of snapshots:
 *
 * - Local (default): These are snapshots that are created locally. They are
 *     stored internally inside qcow2 files and are very efficient. These are
 *     the snapshots usually created by interacting with the UI.
 *
 * - Remote: These are snapshots that have been exported at a certain point.
 *     an exported snapshot is normalized (completely self contained) and
 *     can be imported into an emulator with a similar hardware configuration.
 *
 * Currently the emulator has limited support for importing snapshots:
 * - Once an imported snapshot has been loaded into an emulator it is no longer
 * possible to create new snapshots.
 * - The hardware configuration of the emulator your are pushing a snapshot to
 * must match (or be very similar) to the one you pulled the snapshot from.
 *
 * For example do not expect to be able to restore a snapshot on created on an
 * Intel cpu on an AMD cpu.
